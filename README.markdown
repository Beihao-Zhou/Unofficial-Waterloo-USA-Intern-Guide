## Introduction

This document is unofficial and not endorsed by my school or employers.
I'm not a lawyer, a tax specialist nor do a purport to have any real knowledge.

This is a collection of things I wished I knew when I went away on my first Co-op term to the US.
I hope it helps you out. Many things contained in this document were gained through mistakes and conversations with older students.

This document is a work in progress.
If you are a past intern and have thoughts/ideas to add to this document, let me know.
Even better submit a pull request. I'll note you if you want to be noted.

## Getting The Job

For many, the JobMine process is familiar so I won't speak about that.
You probably know how to get a job.

Something to note is that many companies in the US (particularly California) are much more laid back and don't care if you wear a suit or not.
Depends on the company. I suit up for Morgan Stanley but not Facebook.

If you read earlier, I got my first co-op in the US.
Which is something CECS says not to do in your first year.
Even if you only have 4 months of school under your belt,
there is no actual restriction for going in first year.

### The Pay
Ask the pay in the interview. There is no reason not too.
If they don't want to give it up, I'd recommend you don't take an offer.

Don't believe '*competitive pay*', that can range from $25/hr - $45/hr.

### Relocation
Ask if they offer any help in terms of relocation.

Many companies offer a housing stipend (a bit of money, often taxable).
Some will put you up in subsidized or free housing (Amazon, Apple etc).

Ask if they cover flight.
If you are going to San Francisco, $500-750 round trip after tax as a guide.
You could probably do better with connecting flights.
New York is a lot cheaper.

Sometimes stipends are large, sometimes they are not.
If you're not sure, assume that your stipend will be taxed at ~26% in California.
I've heard you can get much of it back if you save your receipts, something to look into.

I'd recommend against working at a place that does not cover some part of your housing.
If you have the financial ability to not care, then lucky you :-P.

### Perks
Some companies have cool perks like food, bikes, transit passes, happy hour, snacks etc.

It's worth checking out.

## The Visa
Once you have your offer, email your recruiter to get all the details about pay and start date.
Its useful for the visa.

CECS and CDS/AIPT (now Cultural Vistas) will guide you through the process.
If you have questions ask the awesome Cathy Stein. She's amazing.

## Roommates
Chances are you're going to want to split an apartment.
Contact your company and try to get emails of other Waterloo students going down the same time as you.

Contact them and ask them to meet up somewhere in Waterloo for dinner.
It gives everyone a great opportunity to meet each other, get a feel for who would be a good roommate.

I like to find outgoing people who like to travel on weekends, it's a personal choice.

## Apartment Hunting
You'll want to start your search early.

Check out the area specific section for more info.
### General Tips
* Paying a deposit is common.
* Don't pay a deposit of any kind to *see* an apartment.
* Utilities included is less common than Waterloo.
* 4-month leases are harder to come by than Waterloo
* Paying the first months rent in full by certified check is not uncommon
* Bring enough money for first months rent and security
* Cashing a Canadian cheque in the US takes a long time (even if it's a USD account), cash is recommended.
* Sometimes you can get your stipend ahead of time if you already have an American bank account.
* Use CECS's hot housing leads
* Ask your company to ask current interns where they are living and any recommendations they have

## Before You Go
Have a second (or third) copy of all travel documents:

1. DS-2019
2. Passport
3. Training Plan
4. SEVIS fee receipt
5. Resume (for customs, weird eh)
6. Map surrounding hotel/apartment
7. Boarding pass

Don't call it a job or say you are working! The J1 visa status is not meant for "working", but rather for "training" in the United States.
Remember, you're just a poor little intern *training* in the United States!

## Once you Land
Something super important you'll need to know...

## Opening a Bank Account
You'll want to do this as soon as you can, you can do this without an SSN.
Bring your passport and drivers license as well as your student card.
Most banks will give you a free checking account if you are a student.

Note: Some banks have a savings account.
You may not want one for several reasons:

* There may be a minimum balance after 6 months
* Having interest income in the US can complicate taxes (not an expert)

Choosing a Bank is up to you and your preferences.
I'd stick to one of:

* Chase
* Bank of America
* Wells Fargo

If you are in NY Chase is the one to open.
There are so many Chase branches and ATMs.

Bank of America is pretty good in the SF/Bay Area.
Chase is OK there too.

Wells Fargo is known for being super nice.

### Credit Cards
One thing that I and many others try to do right away is get a credit card.

Getting credit in the US is very hard. Especially if you are under 21.

Keep in mind that instead of Interac for debit cards, all American debit cards (also known as "check cards") are actually VISA/MasterCard cards.
You can use them anywhere you would use a credit card except the money comes out of your account immediately.

You can get a Secured Credit card where you put some money into a special account and that amount becomes your credit limit.
Something to look into.

Sometimes you can get BoA or TD America to look up your Canadian credit history.
Really tough if you are under 21.

One surefire way of getting a credit card fairly soon would be to apply for a Capital One credit card that's directly targeted for people with no credit histroy/newcomers. Beware this card is free for the first year, but costs around $30 per year after that.

### Bringing Money Back
There are a lot of ways to bring your hard earned dough back to Canada.

Some really creative ways:

* Bring it in cash across the border (10k limit, it's a lot in $20's, I don't do this anymore)
* Mailing it by UPS/FedEx insured (got this from a TD Canada banker)
* Buying equity on a cross listed item and selling it on a Canadian exchange (best rate I hear, but sounds tricky)

Some more tame ways

* xe.com, this is my preferred method. 1.5% spread which is pretty good.
* Wire transfer
* Cash a check (takes 20-30 days I hear)
* RBC Royal Bank (they have a cross boarder checking account, but the spread is 2.5%, I don't do this any more)
* Using your family member who works at a bank and gets currency exchanged at cost (I'm told this is the best possible)

If you end up with American funds in Canada, I recommend opening a US dollar account and convert it over time so you don't get bit by the exchange rate.

I suck at playing the market so I just transfer money over ~$1k at a time to try and even out my loss/gain.

Keep in mind that some banks charge different spreads depending on how much you transfer.
$1,100 worked best for me.

## Getting your SSN
Apply for your SSN as soon as you have been in the US for at least 10 days. It takes 10 days for SEVIS to sync up with the SSA's database of people eligible to apply for a social security number.

### Application process
1. Fill in form SS-5 available at the [Social Security Administration's website](http://ssa.gov/ssnumber/).
2. Bring forms and documentation to your local SSA office.
3. There is no step three.

### SSA Offices

Mountain View:
 * Not as long of a wait to get into the office (not as much security screening), but took longer for the card to arrive.

San Jose Downtown:
 * Long wait just to get into the building (outdoor wait due to security screening), but card arrived in 2 business days (was promised two weeks).

As with everything else, your mileage may vary.

## Cell Service
Unless you're one of those crazy people who wanders around for wifi (I'm looking at you Deepinder), you'll want to get cell service.

If you just want a phone that makes phone calls and texts (weirdo) you can get some cheap pay as you go phone.
I have a BOOST prepaid phone which I use for when people come to visit me and haven't had any trouble with it.

### BlackBerry ###
There are a few options. I'm a BlackBerry user who would die without BBM and Google Maps.
The main problem is that people don't like giving you data without a 1-2 year commitment.
This section is only about getting your BlackBerry on the network *with BIS*.

I used to use T-Mobile with a weird prepaid plan but they stopped that and make you put down a deposit.
I'm told that this may have changed, you may want to check this one in your state.

My one friend knows a trick with AT&T where you can get them to check your Canadian credit history.
I tried it and spend an hour arguing with the staff telling them it could be done and gave up.
My friend told me it takes about three hours before they will relent, uggh.

I tried SimpleMobile this term (Winter '12) and have mixed feelings.
Their customer support is pretty terrible, they don't know what BIS is and they think data is data.
But you can get it to work, and the service itself is fine (I think they actually are on T-Mobile).

Note, if you have a Rogers/AT&T phone it will likely only get EDGE not 3G.

### Smartphones ###
Getting data for your smartphone is a lot easier than a dumb BlackBerry.

I think T-Mobile and AT&T both offer options in this arena.

In the past some groups were able to get a reduced rate by getting a family plan.

## Shopping
* Amazon has no tax in California
* Amazon gives free shipping for 1 month through Prime, get one intern to signup at a time you can have free shipping all work term
* Woot.com is awesome

## Area Specific Notes
I've been to three main areas and will focus on info for those.
If you are an intern and have more info let me know.

### San Francisco
* Since SF is a city, prices are pretty high.
* Stuff is slanted
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100
* BART from the airport to SF is super clean and ~$8.

### Bay Area
* Still expensive
* Get a SafeWay Card, it's free and literally saved me over $100
* Learn to love the Caltrain
* Caltrain isn't like the GO, they check your tickets all the time
* Go to Gilroy Premium Outlet Mall in Gilroy, it's amazing and has great deals
* Pizza Hut is not as fancy in the US. It will blow your coworkers' minds if you tell them that Pizza Hut is a sit down restaurant with waiters
* Gilroy Premium Outlets is pretty awesome and worth a trip after your first paycheck

### New York
* Really expensive
* Paying first and last months rent plus one month of security is super common.
* Brokers fees are usually 1 month rent, often more than you'd like.
* Brokers fees are super negotiable
* More scammers here than any other place I encountered, see the place before you pay
* Housing moves fast. We got an appointment to see a place, got on the subway right away and once we got out the place was already taken
* Bring checks with you, that's how you secure a place
* Don't live above 100th Street unless you aren't afraid of anything
* Manhattan Costs Money
* Wall street area is surprisingly dead in the evening
* Brooklyn is much cheaper, consider it
* Middle of Brooklyn can be a little sketchier, but Bay Ridge is super beautiful
* Get a MetroCard pass on your first day, $104/mo for unlimited travel is a great deal
* Trader Joe's is cheap
* Chase bank is everywhere (also in Duane Reade)
* Get a Duane Reade Card
* Watch your stuff on the subway, wallet in front and all that stuff
* Flying into LGA is cheaper, NJ transit is good, hard with two suitcases
