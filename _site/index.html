<section id='Introduction' />
<h2 id='introduction'>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is unofficial and not endorsed by my school or employers. I&#8217;m not a lawyer, a tax specialist nor do a purport to have any real knowledge.</p>

<p>This is a collection of things I wished I knew when I went away on my first co-op term to the US. I hope it helps you out. Many things contained in this document were gained through mistakes and conversations with older students.</p>

<p>This document is a work in progress. If you are a past intern and have thoughts/ideas to add to this document, let me know. Even better submit a pull request. I&#8217;ll note you if you want to be noted.</p>
<section id='GettingTheJob' />
<h2 id='getting_the_job'>Getting The Job</h2>

<p>For many, the JobMine process is familiar so I won&#8217;t speak about that. You probably know how to get a job.</p>

<p>Something to note is that many companies in the US (particularly California) are much more laid back and don&#8217;t care if you wear a suit or not. Depends on the company. I suit up for Morgan Stanley but not Facebook.</p>

<p>If you read earlier, I got my first co-op in the US. Which is something CECS says not to do in your first year. Even if you only have 4 months of school under your belt, there is no actual restriction for going in first year.</p>
<section id='ThePay' />
<h3 id='the_pay'>The Pay</h3>

<p>Ask the pay in the interview. There is no reason not too. If they don&#8217;t want to give it up, I&#8217;d recommend you don&#8217;t take an offer.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t believe &#8217;<em>competitive pay</em>&#8217;, that can range from $25/hr - $45/hr.</p>
<section id='Relocation' />
<h3 id='relocation'>Relocation</h3>

<p>Ask if they offer any help in terms of relocation.</p>

<p>Many companies offer a housing stipend (a bit of money, often taxable). Some will put you up in subsidized or free housing (Amazon, Apple etc).</p>

<p>Ask if they cover flight. If you are going to San Francisco, $500-750 round trip after tax as a guide. You could probably do better with connecting flights. New York is a lot cheaper.</p>

<p>Asking your company to put you in a hotel for a few days has always worked out well for me. Instead of making housing decisions while still in Canada (which could be pretty risky), I prefer spending a few days in a hotel at my company&#8217;s expense as I wrap-up apartment search.</p>

<p>Sometimes stipends are large, sometimes they are not. If you&#8217;re not sure, assume that your stipend will be taxed at ~26% in California. I&#8217;ve heard you can get much of it back if you save your receipts, something to look into.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend against working at a place that does not cover some part of your housing. If you have the financial ability to not care, then lucky you :-P.</p>
<section id='Perks' />
<h3 id='perks'>Perks</h3>

<p>Some companies have cool perks like food, bikes, transit passes, happy hour, snacks etc.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth checking out.</p>
<section id='TheVisa' />
<h2 id='the_visa'>The Visa</h2>

<p>Once you have your offer, email your recruiter to get all the details about pay and start date. Its useful for the visa.</p>

<p>CECS and CDS/AIPT (now Cultural Vistas) will guide you through the process. If you have questions ask the awesome Cathy Stein (<a href='mailto:cestein@uwaterloo.ca'>&#099;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#117;&#119;&#097;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#111;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#097;</a>). She&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<section id='Roommates' />
<h2 id='roommates'>Roommates</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s easier (and cheaper) to find a place for 3 or 4 people than it is to for a single person for a 4-month lease.</p>

<p>Contact your company and try to get emails of other Waterloo students going down the same time as you.</p>

<p>Contact them and ask them to meet up somewhere in Waterloo for dinner. It gives everyone a great opportunity to meet each other, get a feel for who would be a good roommate.</p>

<p>I like to find outgoing people who like to travel on weekends, it&#8217;s a personal choice.</p>
<section id='ApartmentHunting' />
<h2 id='apartment_hunting'>Apartment Hunting</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to start your search early.</p>

<p>Check out the area specific section for more info.</p>
<section id='ApartmentTips' />
<h3 id='apartment_tips'>Apartment Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Paying a deposit is common.</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t pay a deposit of any kind to <em>see</em> an apartment.</li>

<li>Utilities included is less common than Waterloo.</li>

<li>4-month leases are harder to come by than Waterloo</li>

<li>Paying the first months rent in full by certified check is not uncommon</li>

<li>Bring enough money for first months rent and security</li>

<li>Cashing a Canadian cheque in the US takes a long time (even if it&#8217;s a USD account), cash is recommended.</li>

<li>Sometimes you can get your stipend ahead of time if you already have an American bank account.</li>

<li>Use CECS&#8217;s hot housing leads</li>

<li>Ask your company to ask current interns where they are living and any recommendations they have</li>
</ul>

<p>Craigslist ends up becoming a website where co-ops end up on usually because of the volume of listings on that website. Before you do so, I would suggest checking &#8220;Vacation Rental&#8221; or &#8220;Corporate Housing&#8221; websites because they usually work better with our 4-month work terms. Some websites I&#8217;ve used are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.airbnb.com/sublets'>Airbnb Sublets</a> &#8211; vacation rentals</li>

<li><a href='http://vrbo.com'>Vacation Rentals by Owner</a> &#8211; vacation rentals</li>

<li><a href='http://www.amsires.com/'>AMSI</a> &#8211; corporate housing</li>

<li><a href='http://www.corporatehousingbyowner.com/'>Corporate Housing by Owner</a> &#8211; corporte housing</li>
</ul>
<section id='BeforeYouGo' />
<h2 id='before_you_go'>Before You Go</h2>

<p>Have a second (or third) copy of all travel documents:</p>

<ol>
<li>DS-2019</li>

<li>Passport</li>

<li>Training Plan</li>

<li>SEVIS fee receipt</li>

<li>Resume (for customs, weird eh)</li>

<li>Map surrounding hotel/apartment</li>

<li>Boarding pass</li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#8217;t call it a job or say you are working! The J1 visa status is not meant for &#8220;working&#8221;, but rather for &#8220;training&#8221; in the United States. Remember, you&#8217;re just a poor little intern <em>training</em> in the United States!</p>

<p>I prefer keeping all the above as a digital copy in my Dropbox/Google Docs so I have instant access to them just in case I lose anything.</p>
<section id='OnceYouLand' />
<h2 id='once_you_land'>Once you Land</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shared ride vans <em>can be</em> cheaper than taxis.</li>

<li>Keep expense receipts, good for taxes.</li>

<li>Something super important you&#8217;ll need to know&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<section id='OpeningABankAccount' />
<h2 id='opening_a_bank_account'>Opening a Bank Account</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to do this as soon as you can, you can do this without an SSN. Bring your passport and drivers license as well as your student card. Most banks will give you a free checking account if you are a student.</p>

<p>Note: Some banks have a savings account. You may not want one for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There may be a minimum balance after 6 months</li>

<li>Having interest income in the US can complicate taxes (not an expert)</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing a Bank is up to you and your preferences. I&#8217;d stick to one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Citibank</li>

<li>Chase</li>

<li>Bank of America</li>

<li>Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in NY Chase is the one to open. There are so many Chase branches and ATMs.</p>

<p>Bank of America is pretty good in the SF/Bay Area. Chase is OK there too.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo is known for being super nice.</p>

<p>You will not need a SSN to open an account at the four listed banks. Bring your passport and visa. You don&#8217;t even need a permanent address. Some have had luck with using their hotel&#8217;s or their company&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always kept a US bank account open. It&#8217;s super useful to have. If you come back to the US again you&#8217;re all setup. If you travel you can get cash easy. If you want to buy stuff online it&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>Some people want to close their account to avoid bank fees. Most banks (BoA, Chase, Wells Fargo) offer a <em>student account</em> for 5 years from when you signup. Bring your student ID card. They don&#8217;t require any minimum activity other than some nominal balance.</p>
<section id='CreditCards' />
<h3 id='credit_cards'>Credit Cards</h3>

<p>One thing that I and many others try to do right away is get a credit card.</p>

<p>Getting credit in the US is very hard. Especially if you are under 21.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that instead of Interac for debit cards, all American debit cards (also known as &#8220;check cards&#8221;) are actually VISA/MasterCard cards. You can use them anywhere you would use a credit card except the money comes out of your account immediately.</p>

<p>You can get a Secured Credit card where you put some money into a special account and that amount becomes your credit limit. Something to look into.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get BoA or TD America to look up your Canadian credit history. TD Ameritrade and BoA has a Canadian credit check form. Really tough if you are under 21.</p>

<h4 id='bank_of_america__canadian_credit_check'>Bank of America - Canadian Credit Check</h4>

<p>This worked for an 18 year old guy with two credit cards in good standing back in Canada. Apply for the card at the branch in person. When asked for your information, inform them that you would like to request a Canadian credit bureau check to augment your US credit bureau reports (especially important if it&#8217;s your first work term in the States). If the representative is knowledgeable, they will process the credit card application normally and then will ask you to call a number (or call for you on your behalf) about 24-48 hours later (excluding weekends). If not, here&#8217;s the number you can call: 1 888 503 6092. They&#8217;ll ask for your Canadian SIN number and your last address in Canada. YMMV.</p>

<p>One surefire way of getting a credit card fairly soon would be to apply for a Capital One credit card that&#8217;s directly targeted for people with no credit histroy/newcomers. Beware this card is free for the first year, but costs around $30 per year after that.</p>
<section id='BringingMoneyBack' />
<h3 id='bringing_money_back'>Bringing Money Back</h3>

<p>There are a lot of ways to bring your hard earned dough back to Canada.</p>

<p>Some really creative ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring it in cash across the border (10k limit, it&#8217;s a lot in $20&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t do this anymore)</li>

<li>Mailing it by UPS/FedEx insured (got this from a TD Canada banker)</li>

<li>Buying equity on a cross listed item and selling it on a Canadian exchange (best rate I hear, but sounds tricky)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more tame ways</p>

<ul>
<li>xe.com, this is my preferred method. 1.5% spread which is pretty good.</li>

<li>Wire transfer</li>

<li>Cash a check (takes 20-30 days I hear)</li>

<li>RBC Royal Bank (they have a cross boarder checking account, but the spread is 2.5%, I don&#8217;t do this any more)</li>

<li>Using your family member who works at a bank and gets currency exchanged at cost (I&#8217;m told this is the best possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you end up with American funds in Canada, I recommend opening a US dollar account and convert it over time so you don&#8217;t get bit by the exchange rate.</p>

<p>I suck at playing the market so I just transfer money over ~$1k at a time to try and even out my loss/gain.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that some banks charge different spreads depending on how much you transfer. $1,100 worked best for me.</p>
<section id='SSN' />
<h2 id='getting_your_ssn'>Getting your SSN</h2>

<p>Apply for your SSN as soon as you have been in the US for at least 10 days. It takes 10 days for SEVIS to sync up with the SSA&#8217;s database of people eligible to apply for a social security number.</p>
<section id='SSNApplication' />
<h3 id='ssn_application'>SSN Application</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fill in form SS-5 available at the <a href='http://ssa.gov/ssnumber/'>Social Security Administration&#8217;s website</a>.</li>

<li>Bring forms and documentation to your local SSA office.</li>

<li>There is no step three.</li>
</ol>
<section id='SSAOffices' />
<h3 id='ssa_offices'>SSA Offices</h3>

<h3 id='mountain_view'>Mountain View</h3>

<p>Not as long of a wait to get into the office (not as much security screening), but took longer for the card to arrive.</p>

<h3 id='san_jose_downtown'>San Jose Downtown</h3>

<p>Long wait just to get into the building (outdoor wait due to security screening), but card arrived in 2 business days (was promised two weeks).</p>

<p>As with everything else, your mileage may vary.</p>
<section id='CellService' />
<h2 id='cell_service'>Cell Service</h2>

<p>Unless you&#8217;re one of those crazy people who wanders around for wifi (I&#8217;m looking at you Deepinder), you&#8217;ll want to get cell service.</p>

<p>If you just want a phone that makes phone calls and texts (weirdo) you can get some cheap pay as you go phone. I have a BOOST prepaid phone which I use for when people come to visit me and haven&#8217;t had any trouble with it.</p>

<p>Akshay just sticks to using Rogers&#8217; BIS One Rate Plan - $35 for 500 MB of BIS data. Then, he uses a SIP client on it to make calls (Google Voice/Voip.ms). You don&#8217;t pay too much to Rogers, and you save on roaming costs as well. Win/win.</p>
<section id='BlackBerry' />
<h3 id='blackberry'>BlackBerry</h3>

<p>There are a few options. I&#8217;m a BlackBerry user who would die without BBM and Google Maps. The main problem is that people don&#8217;t like giving you data without a 1-2 year commitment. This section is only about getting your BlackBerry on the network <em>with BIS</em>.</p>

<p>I used to use T-Mobile with a weird prepaid plan but they stopped that and make you put down a deposit. I&#8217;m told that this may have changed, you may want to check this one in your state.</p>

<p>My one friend knows a trick with AT&amp;T where you can get them to check your Canadian credit history. I tried it and spend an hour arguing with the staff telling them it could be done and gave up. My friend told me it takes about three hours before they will relent, uggh.</p>

<p>I tried SimpleMobile this term (Winter &#8216;12) and have mixed feelings. Their customer support is pretty terrible, they don&#8217;t know what BIS is and they think data is data. But you can get it to work, and the service itself is fine (I think they actually are on T-Mobile).</p>

<p>Note, if you have a Rogers/AT&amp;T phone it will likely only get EDGE not 3G.</p>
<section id='Smartphones' />
<h3 id='smartphones'>Smartphones</h3>

<p>Getting data for your smartphone is a lot easier than a dumb BlackBerry. If you have an unlocked phone, it&#8217;s really easy. You can get a plan with a sim card, pop it in, and walk out of the store Facebooking up a storm.</p>

<p>I think T-Mobile and AT&amp;T both offer options in this arena.</p>

<p>In the past some groups were able to get a reduced rate by getting a family plan.</p>
<section id='Taxes' />
<h2 id='taxes'>Taxes</h2>

<p><em>Dislaimer</em>: No author of this document knows anything about taxes, accounting or even arithmetic. Do not rely on this document. Speak to a professional.</p>

<p>CECS has <a href='http://www.ceca.uwaterloo.ca/students/international/US_Income_Tax.php'>some information</a> on taxes. Stephen plans on being lazy and using &#8220;Peter Cuttini&#8221; (contact info on Waterloo site) this term. He&#8217;s heard good things about him for co-op students. (Around $300).</p>

<p>H&amp;R Block will also do it for around $300.</p>

<p>Some people have had luck with this <a href='http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=107626,00.html'>free government program</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly you will have to pay taxes on your hard-earned income. Chances are you already paid the American ones in your paycheque. Depending on your State and situation you will end up receiving much (50% is not unreasonable) of that back. You may owe money in Canada. You definitely have to fill out both Canadian Federal and Provincial forms as well as US Federal and State.</p>

<p>There are short versions of US forms for non-residents (you may not apply) which Stephen used last tax year.</p>

<p>The main question Stephen had was whether I had to pay taxes twice in both Canada and the US. In his situation, Canada knew how much he was taxed in the US and applied some formula to not tax him twice.</p>
<section id='Shopping' />
<h2 id='shopping'>Shopping</h2>

<ul>
<li>Amazon has no tax in California</li>

<li>Amazon gives free shipping for 1 month through Prime, get one intern to signup at a time you can have free shipping all work term</li>

<li>Woot.com is awesome</li>
</ul>
<section id='AreaSpecificNotes' />
<h2 id='area_specific_notes'>Area Specific Notes</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been to three main areas and will focus on info for those. If you are an intern and have more info let me know.</p>
<section id='SanFrancisco' />
<h3 id='san_francisco'>San Francisco</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since SF is a city, prices are pretty high - it has <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/14/san-francisco-rents-the-highest-in-nation_n_1345275.html'>the highest rent in the country</a>, for example.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s very tough to find housing in the city, especially for cheap (as of Spring 2012). Craigslist is your best resource; email early and email often.</li>

<li>Stuff is slanted. They&#8217;re not exaggerating in movies and pictures, the hills are <em>steep</em>. You know that scene in The Princess Diaries where she&#8217;s pushing her scooter up the hill? I know you watched it - that&#8217;s not a cheap scooter, those hills are vicious.</li>

<li>Get a SafeWay Card, it&#8217;s free and literally saved me over $100.</li>

<li>There are some beautiful parts (check out the Presidio near the Golden Gate Bridge), some crazy parts (Haight-Ashbury has things you never imagined existed. Everyone is high.), and some very sketchy parts (Stay out of the Tenderloin, especially at night. I repeat, <em>stay out of the Tenderloin at night</em>.) Familiarize yourself with the neighbourhoods and use common sense.</li>

<li>Fun fact - it has <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/families-flee-san-francisco_n_1335639.html'>the lowest proportion of children of any major city in the US</a>! If you hate the smelly little buggers, you&#8217;re in good company.</li>
</ul>
<section id='SanFranciscoTransportation' />
<h4 id='transportation'>Transportation</h4>

<ul>
<li>MUNI is the basic transit service, there are buses, streetcars, cable cars (streetcars that go up steep hills, $6/ride and in tourist areas) and subways as well.</li>

<li>BART is a high-speed subway-ish system that goes around the more city-like parts of the Bay Area and hits more major destinations. BART from the airport to SF is super clean and ~$8.</li>

<li>Caltrain is a light-rail system that goes through all of Silicon Valley for under $10. If you&#8217;ve heard of the GO train in the GTA, it&#8217;s the same thing.</li>

<li>Clipper Card is a free card you can get and load with money which can be used on all of these transit systems seamlessly. Get one.</li>
</ul>
<section id='BayArea' />
<h3 id='bay_area'>Bay Area</h3>

<ul>
<li>Still expensive</li>

<li>Get a SafeWay Card, it&#8217;s free and literally saved me over $100</li>

<li>Learn to love the Caltrain</li>

<li>Caltrain isn&#8217;t like the GO, they check your tickets all the time</li>

<li>Go to Gilroy Premium Outlet Mall in Gilroy, it&#8217;s amazing and has great deals</li>

<li>Pizza Hut is not as fancy in the US. It will blow your coworkers&#8217; minds if you tell them that Pizza Hut is a sit down restaurant with waiters</li>

<li>Gilroy Premium Outlets is pretty awesome and worth a trip after your first paycheck</li>
</ul>
<section id='NewYork' />
<h3 id='new_york'>New York</h3>

<ul>
<li>Really expensive</li>

<li>Paying first and last months rent plus one month of security is super common.</li>

<li>Brokers fees are usually 1 month rent, often more than you&#8217;d like.</li>

<li>Brokers fees are super negotiable</li>

<li>More scammers here than any other place I encountered, see the place before you pay</li>

<li>Housing moves fast. We got an appointment to see a place, got on the subway right away and once we got out the place was already taken</li>

<li>Bring checks with you, that&#8217;s how you secure a place</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t live above 100th Street unless you aren&#8217;t afraid of anything</li>

<li>Manhattan Costs Money</li>

<li>Wall street area is surprisingly dead in the evening</li>

<li>Brooklyn is much cheaper, consider it</li>

<li>Middle of Brooklyn can be a little sketchier, but Bay Ridge is super beautiful</li>

<li>Get a MetroCard pass on your first day, $104/mo for unlimited travel is a great deal</li>

<li>Trader Joe&#8217;s is cheap</li>

<li>Chase bank is everywhere (also in Duane Reade)</li>
